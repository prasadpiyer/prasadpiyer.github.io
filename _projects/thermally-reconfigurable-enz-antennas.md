### Antennas that adapt in real time

Conventional optics is static—once you fabricate a lens or antenna, its properties are fixed forever. But what if **optical devices could reshape themselves on demand**, adapting to changing environments, switching tasks, or optimizing performance in real time?

We're making this vision real using **phase-change materials** (VO₂, GST) and **epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) substrates** that amplify tiny perturbations into dramatic optical shifts. By depositing nanophotonic antennas onto ENZ films like doped indium oxide and cadmium oxide, we exploit extreme field confinement near the zero-index transition to achieve resonance shifts, Q-factor tuning, and radiation pattern reconfiguration with milliwatt-scale heating or modest voltages.

### Extreme tunability from exotic materials

**Ultrafast VO₂ switching** ― When vanadium dioxide transitions from insulator to metal, it doesn't do it halfway. Our metasurface modulators achieve >90% amplitude modulation at 2 μm wavelengths using femtosecond pump-probe switching—turning infrared light on and off faster than any mechanical or electro-optic device.

**ENZ amplification of thermo-optic effects** ― Conventional silicon antennas shift by ~0.1 nm per Kelvin. Boring. By coupling dielectric resonators to ENZ substrates, we've demonstrated 5 nm/V tuning (10× enhancement) while maintaining high Q-factors >150. The secret? ENZ materials concentrate fields so intensely that even tiny refractive index changes trigger massive resonance shifts.

**Thermally reconfigurable meta-lenses** ― Forget fixed optics. Our binary-phase CdO pillar arrays dynamically reconfigure focal length from 50 to 120 μm with just 10 milliwatts of Joule heating. It's adaptive imaging without moving parts—lenses that literally reprogram themselves via temperature.

**Micro-Kelvin efficiency** ― Thanks to the extreme field enhancement near ENZ transitions, we achieve optical reconfiguration with microkelvin-per-milliwatt efficiency. This isn't lab curiosity—it's practical tunability at power budgets compatible with battery-operated devices.

### The programmable optics era

We're pioneering a future where **optical components are no longer passive fixtures, but active, intelligent elements** that sense, adapt, and optimize. Adaptive infrared cameras that reconfigure their spectral response on the fly. Programmable thermal emitters for radiative cooling. Dynamic wavefront shapers for free-space communication that compensates for atmospheric turbulence in real time. The static optics era is ending—reconfigurable photonics is here.
