### Overview
By patterning **Ni nano-islands** into kagome and square-ice lattices we create two-dimensional frustrated magnets that double as plasmonic metasurfaces. The metallic nature of Ni enables both strong optical resonances and tunable magnetic interactions, opening a rich playground for **magneto-plasmonic phase engineering**.

### Key contributions
1. **Plasmon-enhanced magneto-optics** – achieved >5× enhancement of Kerr rotation at localised surface plasmon resonances, reported in *ACS Photonics*.
2. **Field-induced vs spontaneous phase transitions** – discovered a critical crossover near the super-paramagnetic limit where vertex populations switch behaviour without external bias (manuscript in review).
3. **Laser-PEEM imaging of spin-ice** – developed a UV-driven photo-electron emission microscope that maps vertex configurations via plasmonic hot-spots, offering a table-top alternative to synchrotron X-PEEM.

### Impact
Our Ni metasurfaces provide a compact platform to study **out-of-equilibrium frustrated magnetism** and to harness magneto-plasmonic interactions for tunable non-reciprocal optics.
