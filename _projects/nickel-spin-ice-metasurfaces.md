### Overview
Magnetic dipole interactions, optical interference and spin statistics naturally encode the Ising Hamiltonian. We exploit this by (i) fabricating **artificial spin-ice lattices** in nickel that manifest frustrated magnetism and (ii) building **free-space photonic Ising machines** whose diffraction patterns compute spin couplings in parallel. Together, these systems serve as *natural* analogue computers for optimisation and for exploring non-equilibrium physics.

### Key contributions
1. **Nickel artificial spin-ice metasurfaces** – plasmonic Ni nano-islands arranged in kagome and square-ice lattices exhibit tunable frustration and >5× magneto-optic enhancement.
2. **Ultrafast magneto-plasmonic microscopy** – laser-PEEM movies that track vertex flipping with femtosecond temporal and 30 nm spatial resolution.
3. **Free-space Ising machine with 2 M spins** – optical Fourier transforms implement fully-connected couplings, solving Max-Cut and spinodal decomposition in milliseconds.
4. **Hybrid electro-optic feedback** – combining SLMs with CMOS detectors to realise reprogrammable, room-temperature Ising hardware.

### Impact
By uniting **materials-encoded spin networks** with **photonic analogue processors** we create scalable, energy-efficient platforms for solving NP-hard problems and uncover emergent magnetic phenomena.

> *Carousel to display PEEM snapshots, optimisation trajectories and Ising energy landscapes will be added soon.*
