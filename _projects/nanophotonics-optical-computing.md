### What if experiments could teach themselves?

Imagine nanophotonic systems that autonomously discover how to manipulate femtosecond pulses—exploring billions of configurations faster than any human could, uncovering hidden physics along the way. This is **self-driving nanophotonics**, where AI doesn't just assist experiments—it becomes the experimentalist.

Our flagship platform, **AutoSciLab**, transforms laboratories into autonomous discovery engines. By combining machine learning techniques including variational autoencoders, active learning, and neural network equation learners, it closes the design–fabrication–characterization loop in *minutes*, not months. The result? Physical insights that humans never imagined, extracted automatically from high-dimensional experimental data.

### Breakthrough discoveries

**Ultrafast spin steering** ― We've shattered the speed limit for controlling light's polarization. Our chiral metasurfaces independently rotate left- and right-handed circularly-polarized beams by >30° within *140 femtoseconds*—enabling sub-picosecond manipulation of ultrafast quantum states and spin-encoded information.

**Physics-aware optical computing** ― Forget digital gates. Our photonic Ising machines harness free-space diffraction to solve 2-million-spin optimization problems at kilohertz rates, using only Fourier optics. NP-hard problems that stump conventional computers yield to light in milliseconds.

**Chip-scale femtosecond diagnostics** ― By encoding quadratic phase profiles into metasurfaces, we've built the world's first passive photonic streak camera—deflecting 300-femtosecond pulses by 15° to capture ultrafast dynamics without complex electronics.

**Autonomous discovery at scale** ― AutoSciLab has autonomously rediscovered Newton's laws from projectile motion and uncovered new structure–property relationships in nanophotonic emission—demonstrating that AI can not only optimize, but truly *understand* physical systems.

### Why this matters

We're engineering a future where **photonic processors think, adapt, and compute at light speed**—where terahertz-bandwidth decision-making enables real-time sensing, ultrafast communication, and computational paradigms impossible with electrons. The age of programmable light has arrived.
