### Overview
Our group develops **self-driving, reconfigurable nanophotonic platforms** that can actively sense their optical response and re-train themselves in real time. By combining machine-learning control loops with high-fidelity electromagnetic solvers (AutoSciLab) we design, fabricate and deploy metasurfaces that can steer and sculpt light on demand.

### Key contributions
1. **Coherent beam steering from active metasurfaces** – demonstrated broadband steering of coherent emission by autonomously searching a gigantic design space of nano-antennas.
2. **Chiral bound-state-in-continuum (BIC) metasurfaces** – achieved >30° steering of *circularly polarised* beams directly from chiral BICs, enabling spin-selective LiDAR and microscopy.
3. **Electrically reconfigurable micro-LEDs** – integrated nanoscale liquid-crystal layers with III-nitride LEDs to obtain on-chip, voltage-tunable colour and directionality.
4. **Ultrafast temporal phase engineering** – encoded femtosecond-scale quadratic phases that streak single optical pulses by 15° within <300 fs, realising a solid-state photonic streak camera.
5. **Photonic Ising machines for materials science** – built a free-space Ising solver with 2×10⁶ spins to track spinodal decomposition and other non-equilibrium phase transformations. The same platform multiplexes arbitrary logical operations through Fourier-domain convolutional neural networks.

### Impact
These advances lay the groundwork for *fully autonomic photonic systems* that can sense, decide and actuate purely with light—pushing optics into regimes traditionally dominated by electronics.
