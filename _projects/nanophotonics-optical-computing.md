### Overview
We develop **self-driving nanophotonic platforms** that integrate machine-learning control loops with on-chip actuators to sculpt femtosecond light fields on demand. Our in-house GPU stack, *AutoSciLab*, couples real-time electromagnetic simulation with Bayesian optimisation and reinforcement learning to close the design–fabrication–characterisation loop within minutes.

### Key contributions
1. **Ultrafast steering of circularly-polarised beams** – chiral bound-state-in-continuum metasurfaces that rotate the far-field of left- and right-handed spins independently by >30° in a single optical cycle.
2. **AutoSciLab** – an open, GPU-accelerated framework that unifies FDTD, differentiable scattering solvers and ML agents to enable autonomous nanophotonics.
3. **Solid-state photonic streak camera** – femtosecond-encoded quadratic phases that deflect single pulses by 15° within 300 fs, providing a chip-scale temporal diagnostic.
4. **Physics-aware photonic Ising machines** – free-space optics that solve 2×10⁶-spin combinatorial problems at kHz rates using Fourier-domain convolution.

### Impact
These results chart a path toward **fully autonomic, ultrafast photonic processors** that can sense, decide and actuate at terahertz bandwidths—ushering light-based computation into real-world sensing and communication systems.

> *Interactive carousels featuring beam-steering movies, AutoSciLab dashboards and streak-camera images forthcoming.*
