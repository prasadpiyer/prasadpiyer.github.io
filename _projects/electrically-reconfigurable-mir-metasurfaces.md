### Infrared control at the flip of a switch

Thermal cameras. Chemical sensors. Free-space optical links. Mid-infrared (MIR) photonics powers critical technologies—but traditional systems rely on bulky mechanical scanners, cryogenic cooling, or slow thermal tuning. What if you could **electrically reconfigure infrared optics as easily as you switch transistors**?

We've made it possible by marrying **III–V semiconductor resonators with voltage-triggered phase transitions** in vanadium dioxide (VO₂). When you apply voltage, VO₂ flips from insulator to metal in nanoseconds, dramatically shifting optical properties. Paired with engineered heterojunction resonators, this creates MIR metasurfaces offering >2π phase modulation at sub-10 V bias—solid-state infrared control with no moving parts.

### Phase transitions meet photonics

**Heterojunction resonators with 180° phase swing** ― Our pioneering *Advanced Optical Materials* work demonstrated that GaInAs/AlInAs resonators could achieve 180° phase shifts across 200 nm bandwidth when integrated with carrier-injection junctions. This dual-channel control (carrier density + VO₂ switching) gives unprecedented programmability.

**20 dB modulation at 5 volts** ― Forget multi-kilovolt modulators. Our voltage-switched VO₂ devices deliver 20 dB optical contrast at just 5 V—compatible with CMOS drive electronics. Fast, efficient, and scalable.

**Steering 4 μm light at 40 kHz** ― We've built 1×64 phased arrays that electrically steer mid-infrared beams by ±30° with 40 kHz refresh rates. No mirrors, no motors—just voltage-controlled phase transitions performing beam scanning faster than mechanical systems can dream of.

**Sub-picosecond ultrafast control** ― By combining femtosecond pump pulses with metasurface-encoded phases, we've achieved sub-picosecond steering of incoherent emission from semiconductors—opening doors to ultrafast infrared imaging and communication.

### Transforming infrared technology

We're replacing the mechanical past with an **all-electronic infrared future**. Low-power, chip-scale, and faster than any moving part, electrically reconfigurable MIR metasurfaces are poised to revolutionize thermal imaging (no more scanning mirrors), chemical spectroscopy (programmable filters at video rates), and free-space optical communication (adaptive beam forming for mobile links).
