### Deterministic quantum light, by design

The promise of quantum computing hinges on a deceptively simple challenge: generating single photons on demand, with perfect indistinguishability, at room temperature, on a manufacturable chip. For decades, this has been a fundamental bottleneck. We're solving it by **engineering the quantum vacuum itself**.

Our approach reimagines semiconductor quantum dots not as isolated atoms, but as **active components embedded within designer photonic environments**. By wrapping GaAs quantum emitters in metasurfaces, dielectric nanocavities, and carrier-funneling nanostructures, we control spontaneous emission at the most fundamental level—dictating where, when, and how photons are born.

### Quantum emitters, turbocharged

**Metasurface-enhanced extraction** ― Standard quantum dots lose 99% of their photons to substrate modes. We've changed the game: our *Nano Letters* metasurface integration achieves order-of-magnitude collection efficiency enhancement while preserving near-perfect indistinguishability—the holy grail for quantum communication.

**Deterministic brightness without trade-offs** ― Conventional wisdom says you sacrifice coherence for brightness. Not here. Our graded-bandgap carrier funnels guide charge carriers to quantum dots with order-of-magnitude efficiency enhancement, delivering bright emission without degrading quantum properties. It's deterministic single-photon generation at scale.

**Three photons from one quantum dot** ― By engineering super-bunched trion cascades (XX⁺→2X⁺ transitions), we've coaxed single quantum dots to emit *three temporally ordered photons* in a controlled sequence. This opens pathways to on-chip cluster states and photonic quantum computing.

**Monolithic quantum circuits** ― Waveguide routers and integrated metalenses don't just collect photons—they direct them into on-chip photonic circuits with sub-decibel loss. For the first time, we're building quantum systems where emitters and photonic logic coexist on the same semiconductor wafer.

### The quantum future, now manufacturable

We're not just improving quantum emitters—we're **industrializing quantum photonics**. By co-designing emitters with their photonic environments, we're paving the way to wafer-scale quantum chips where every photon source is deterministic, every qubit is addressable, and quantum networks become as manufacturable as transistors.
