### Overview
We tailor the photonic environment of **epitaxially grown GaAs quantum dots** using designer metasurfaces and dielectric nanocavities. Precise mode matching boosts extraction efficiency, controls spontaneous-emission pathways and enables multi-photon quantum correlations—all within a monolithic III–V platform.

### Key contributions
1. **Metasurface-embedded quantum emitters** – our *Nano Letters* work demonstrated 15× improved collection efficiency while preserving indistinguishability.
2. **Carrier-funnelling nanobeams** – graded-bandgap funnels yield >80 % brightness without sacrificing coherence.
3. **Super-bunched trion cascades** – engineering XX⁺→2−X⁺ transitions to produce temporally ordered three-photon states from a single dot.
4. **On-chip photon routing** – integrated waveguide routers and metalenses direct emitted photons to photonic circuitry with sub-dB loss.

### Impact
These advances push toward **wafer-scale, deterministic quantum photonic chips** where every emitter is co-designed with its photonic environment, unlocking scalable quantum networks and sensing.
