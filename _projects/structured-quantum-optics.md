### Overview
We harness **epitaxially grown GaAs quantum dots** embedded inside designer metasurfaces to mould their spontaneous emission, extraction efficiency and quantum correlations. By merging bottom-up semiconductor growth with top-down nanofabrication we build fully integrated sources for quantum information processing.

### Key contributions
1. **Metasurface-integrated quantum emitters** – reported in *Nano Letters*, our platform boosts out-coupling into diffraction-limited spots while preserving photon indistinguishability.
2. **Charge-carrier funnels for >80 % brightness** – introduced a graded-bandgap nanobeam that funnels carriers towards a single dot, achieving record brightness without compromising coherence.
3. **Super-bunched trion cascades (planned)** – exploiting XX⁺→2−X⁺ cascades to generate temporally ordered multiphoton states from a single, electrically isolated dot.

### Impact
Our results pave the way for **deterministic, wafer-scale quantum photonic chips** where every quantum emitter is pre-aligned to its photonic environment and individually addressable.
