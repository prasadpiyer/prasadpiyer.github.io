### Programmable optics at the flip of a switch

Autonomous cars. AR headsets. Thermal cameras. Chemical sensors. The vision systems powering tomorrow's technology all demand something that doesn't exist at scale: **electrically programmable optics that bend light on command, consume milliwatts, and fit on a semiconductor chip**.

We're making this real by engineering metasurfaces with voltage-tunable materials—from **liquid crystals** that modulate near-infrared with sub-5 V drive to **vanadium dioxide phase transitions** that flip mid-infrared properties in nanoseconds. It's photonics controlled as easily as transistors, with no moving parts.

## Liquid Crystal Meta-Optics

### Reinventing beam control for LiDAR and displays

The displays in your phone. The LiDAR guiding autonomous cars. Future AR glasses that seamlessly blend digital and physical worlds. All rely on **liquid crystal meta-optics**—the convergence of voltage-tunable anisotropic materials with nanophotonic resonators.

**10,000 phase shifters on your fingernail** ― Our patented row/column-addressable architecture (US 11,487,183) crams >10,000 individually controllable phase elements onto a 3×3 mm chip. Solid-state LiDAR with MEMS-beating speed, mechanical robustness, and wafer-scale manufacturability.

**Light that changes color and direction on demand** ― By monolithically integrating liquid crystal overlayers with GaN micro-LEDs, we've built active light sources that electrically tune both emission color *and* beam angle. Imagine displays where every pixel is also a steerable projector—perfect for next-generation AR/VR.

**Achromatic across the visible spectrum** ― Dispersion kills most beam steering—until now. Our multi-layer LC-metasurface stacks maintain constant deflection angles from 450 to 950 nm, enabling broadband solid-state optics for depth sensing and optical communications.

**Dynamic holography at 60 Hz** ― Centimeter-scale phased arrays driven at <5 V reconstruct live 3D holographic scenes at video frame rates. Real-time holographic projection isn't science fiction anymore—it's voltage-controlled nanophotonics.

## Phase-Transition Photonics

### Infrared control via VO₂ and heterojunction resonators

Thermal imaging. Chemical spectroscopy. Free-space optical links. Mid-infrared (MIR) photonics powers critical technologies—but traditional systems rely on bulky mechanical scanners or cryogenic cooling. We've changed the game by marrying **III–V semiconductor resonators with voltage-triggered phase transitions** in vanadium dioxide (VO₂).

**Heterojunction resonators with 180° phase swing** ― Our pioneering *Advanced Optical Materials* work demonstrated that GaInAs/AlInAs resonators achieve 180° phase shifts across 200 nm bandwidth when integrated with carrier-injection junctions. Dual-channel control (carrier density + VO₂ switching) gives unprecedented programmability.

**20 dB modulation at 5 volts** ― Forget multi-kilovolt modulators. Our voltage-switched VO₂ devices deliver 20 dB optical contrast at just 5 V—compatible with CMOS drive electronics. Fast, efficient, and scalable.

**Steering 4 μm light at 40 kHz** ― We've built 1×64 phased arrays that electrically steer mid-infrared beams by ±30° with 40 kHz refresh rates. No mirrors, no motors—just voltage-controlled phase transitions performing beam scanning faster than mechanical systems can dream of.

**Sub-picosecond ultrafast control** ― By combining femtosecond pump pulses with metasurface-encoded phases, we've achieved sub-picosecond steering of incoherent emission from semiconductors—opening doors to ultrafast infrared imaging and communication.

**Generating entangled photons** ― Beyond classical control, we're exploring the quantum frontier. Our voltage-tunable metasurfaces can generate Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) photons, emitting entangled photon pairs on demand—compact, chip-scale quantum light sources.

## From lab to product

We're replacing the mechanical past with an **all-electronic photonics future**. Low-power, wafer-scale, and faster than any moving part, electrically reconfigurable metasurfaces are poised to:

* **Transform automotive LiDAR** — Solid-state beam steering replacing MEMS mirrors
* **Enable glasses-free 3D displays** — Dynamic holographic projection at video rates
* **Revolutionize thermal imaging** — Programmable infrared filters without scanning mirrors
* **Accelerate chemical spectroscopy** — Tunable filters at video rates for real-time sensing
* **Power adaptive free-space communication** — Beam forming that tracks mobile links

The age of programmable light has arrived.
