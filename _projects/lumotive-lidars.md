### Solid-state vision for autonomous machines

Autonomous cars need eyes. AR headsets need depth sensing. Delivery drones need real-time 3D mapping. They all need LiDAR—but today's mechanical scanners are expensive, fragile, power-hungry, and physically too large. The future of machine vision demands something radically different: **solid-state beam steering with no moving parts**.

This is what we built at Lumotive. By engineering **row/column-addressable liquid crystal metasurfaces**, we've created phased arrays that electrically steer near-infrared laser pulses across >120° with sub-millidegree precision—powered by just 5 volts. It's LiDAR on a chip: compact, reliable, and manufacturable at wafer scale.

### Industrial-scale photonic innovation

**10,000 phase shifters, zero moving parts** ― Our patented cross-bar electrode architecture (US 11,487,183) packs >10,000 individually controllable phase elements onto a 3 mm aperture. Every element responds independently, enabling programmable beam patterns impossible with mechanical mirrors. This isn't incremental—it's a fundamental rethink of how LiDAR works.

**CMOS-compatible voltages** ― Traditional liquid crystal modulators need tens of volts. Ours achieve >2π phase modulation at <4 V peak-to-peak by integrating ultra-thin nematic LC layers atop high-index metasurface resonators. Low voltage means low power, simple drive electronics, and compatibility with standard CMOS chips.

**Holographic scanning at 10 kHz** ― Forget single-spot raster scanning. Our dynamic holographic beam forming creates multiple beams simultaneously, enabling flash illumination of entire scenes and adaptive region-of-interest scanning at >10 kHz update rates. It's intelligent LiDAR that looks where it needs to, when it needs to.

**Wafer-scale manufacturing** ― Unlike MEMS mirrors (which require complex 3D packaging) or spinning polygons (mechanically limited), LC metasurfaces are fabricated with standard semiconductor lithography. One wafer produces hundreds of chips. This is how you make LiDAR affordable enough for every car, every robot, every headset.

### From research to roads

We didn't just publish papers—we **built a product**. Lumotive's LC-metasurface LiDAR is rugged (no moving parts to break), low-power (milliwatts, not watts), and cost-effective (wafer-scale production). It's the beam-steering technology that will enable the next generation of autonomous vehicles, mobile robots, and immersive AR/VR experiences.
