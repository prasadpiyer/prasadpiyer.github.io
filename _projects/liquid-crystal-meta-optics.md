### Programmable light at millivolt scales

The displays in your phone. The LiDAR guiding autonomous cars. Future AR glasses that seamlessly blend digital and physical worlds. All demand a technology that doesn't yet exist at scale: **electrically programmable optics that bend light on command, consume milliwatts, and fit on a semiconductor chip**.

Enter **liquid crystal meta-optics**—the convergence of voltage-tunable anisotropic materials with nanophotonic resonators. By integrating sub-wavelength liquid crystal layers atop metasurfaces and III-nitride micro-LEDs, we've created compact optical systems that steer, focus, and modulate light across tens of degrees with microsecond response times—all powered by voltages you could run off a watch battery.

### Reinventing beam control

**10,000 phase shifters on your fingernail** ― Our patented row/column-addressable architecture (US 11,487,183) crams >10,000 individually controllable phase elements onto a 3×3 mm chip. This isn't just dense—it's a paradigm shift. Solid-state LiDAR with MEMS-beating speed, mechanical robustness, and wafer-scale manufacturability.

**Light that changes color and direction on demand** ― By monolithically integrating liquid crystal overlayers with GaN micro-LEDs, we've built active light sources that electrically tune both emission color *and* beam angle. Imagine displays where every pixel is also a steerable projector—perfect for next-generation AR/VR where field-of-view and efficiency are everything.

**Achromatic across the visible spectrum** ― Dispersion kills most beam steering—until now. Our multi-layer LC-metasurface stacks maintain constant deflection angles from 450 to 950 nm, enabling broadband solid-state optics for everything from depth sensing to optical communications.

**Dynamic holography at 60 Hz** ― Centimeter-scale phased arrays driven at <5 V reconstruct live 3D holographic scenes at video frame rates. Real-time holographic projection isn't science fiction anymore—it's voltage-controlled nanophotonics.

### From lab to product

We're not just demonstrating concepts—we're **building the optical engines for tomorrow's mobility, communication, and display industries**. Low-power, wafer-scale, and far more reliable than mechanical alternatives, liquid crystal meta-optics are poised to replace MEMS mirrors in automotive LiDAR, enable glasses-free 3D displays, and unlock optical wireless links that follow you as you move.
