### Overview
Liquid crystals (LCs) provide large, anisotropic index modulation at millivolt-per-micron fields. By marrying sub-wavelength LC layers with metasurfaces and III-nitride emitters we realise **compact, programmable meta-optics** that steer light across tens of degrees with microsecond response—key for next-generation displays and LiDAR.

### Key contributions
1. **Row/Column-addressable LC metasurface (Lumotive patents)** – patented architecture (US 11,487,183) that enables >10 000 independent phase shifters on a 3 × 3 mm aperture for solid-state beam steering.
2. **Electrically reconfigurable micro-LEDs** – monolithically integrating LC overlayers with GaN μLEDs achieves colour- and angle-tunable emission suitable for AR/VR.
3. **Wideband achromatic steering** – multi-layer LC/multifunctional metasurface stacks maintain constant deflection from 450–950 nm.
4. **On-chip holographic projector** – centimetre-scale phased arrays driven at <5 V reconstruct dynamic 3D scenes at 60 Hz.

### Impact
Our LC meta-optics deliver **low-power, wafer-level beam steering** that outperforms MEMS mirrors in speed and reliability, opening pathways for automotive LiDAR, optical wireless links and immersive displays.
