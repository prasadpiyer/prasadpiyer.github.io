Liquid-crystal (LC) metasurfaces enable electronically programmable phase profiles for beam steering and reconfigurable optics. Building on our patents — cross-backplane reflector designs [US 11,429,008], sealed LC packaging and device integration [US 11,487,183], and extended-depth dielectric cavities with LC-filled channels [US 11,914,266] — we implement compact meta‑optic platforms that offer large phase modulation, low-loss operation, and scalable electrical addressing.
