Semicondcutor quantum dot experiments were performed at 15 ± 5 K in an optical cryostat. A wide‑field microscope with a CCD was used to locate individual QDs, after which a confocal setup excited single QDs using a fiber‑coupled 515 nm laser diode operated below threshold. Emission was collected with a 50×, NA 0.42 objective and analyzed by a spectrometer with a 1200 g/mm grating. Two long‑pass filters blocked the excitation light. The same optical path was used for power‑dependence and g(2)(t) measurements; for the latter, angle‑tunable short‑pass and long‑pass edge filters isolated the main QD transition. The second‑order correlation g(2)(t) was obtained from the photon counts in two superconducting nanowire broadband detectors as functions of time.
