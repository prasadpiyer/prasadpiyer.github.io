abstract: "We demonstrate control of quantized spontaneous emission from single GaAs quantum dots embedded in Huygens' metasurfaces. By engineering the local density of optical states, we achieve enhanced quantum efficiency and improved photon statistics, enabling new approaches to quantum information applications."
