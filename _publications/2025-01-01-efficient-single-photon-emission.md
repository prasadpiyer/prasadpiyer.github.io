abstract: "We demonstrate a novel approach to enhance single-photon emission efficiency through quantum-confined charge funneling to quantum dots. By engineering the charge transport and confinement in semiconductor nanostructures, we achieve improved photon collection efficiency and reduced decoherence, making it promising for quantum information applications."
