abstract: 'Advances in robotic control and sensing have propelled the rise of automated
  scientific laboratories capable of high-throughput experiments. However, automated
  scientific laboratories are currently limited by human intuition in their ability
  to efficiently design and interpret experiments in high-dimensional spaces, throttling
  scientific discovery. We present AutoSciLab, a machine learning framework for driving
  autonomous scientific experiments, forming a surrogate researcher purposed for scientific
  discovery in high-dimensional spaces. AutoSciLab autonomously follows the scientific
  method in four steps: (i) generating high-dimensional experiments (x \in R^D) using
  a variational autoencoder (ii) selecting optimal experiments by forming hypotheses
  using active learning (iii) distilling the experimental results to discover relevant
  low-dimensional latent variables (z \in R^d, with d<<D) with a ''directional autoencoder''
  and (iv) learning a human interpretable equation connecting the discovered latent
  variables with a quantity of interest (y = f(z)), using a neural network equation
  learner. We validate the generalizability of AutoSciLab by rediscovering a) the
  principles of projectile motion and b) the phase transitions within the spin-states
  of the Ising model (NP-hard problem). Applying our framework to an open-ended nanophotonics
  challenge, AutoSciLab uncovers a fundamentally novel method for directing incoherent
  light emission that surpasses the current state-of-the-art (Iyer et al. 2023b, 2020).'
