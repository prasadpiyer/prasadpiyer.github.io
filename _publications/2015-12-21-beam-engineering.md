abstract: "Multipolar electromagnetic phenomena in subwavelength resonators are at the heart of metamaterial science and technology. In this work, we demonstrate selective and enhanced coupling to specific multipolar resonances via beam engineering. Using an analytical method derived from Mie theory that depends only on local electromagnetic field quantities, we show that varying illumination properties can drastically manipulate the scattering properties of a spherical nanoparticle and enable excitation of a longitudinal quadrupole mode that cannot be accessed with conventional illumination. This approach enhances the understanding of fundamental light–matter interactions in metamaterials and lays the foundation for tailoring multipolar interactions through optical beam engineering."
