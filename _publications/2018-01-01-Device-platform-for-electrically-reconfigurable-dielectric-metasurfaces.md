abstract: Achieving an electrically tunable phased array optical antenna surface has
  been a principal challenge in the field of metasurfaces. In this letter, we demonstrate
  a device platform for achieving reconfigurable control over the resonant wavelength
  of a subwavelength optical antenna through free-carrier injection. We engineer and
  grow, using molecular beam epitaxy, a heterostructure of In1-xAlxAs/InAs/AlyGa1-ySb
  layers designed to achieve large amplitude and phase modulation of light by maximizing
  the refractive index change in regions of resonant field enhancement The p-i-n layers
  are grown on a heavily doped n-InAs layer which forms a reflecting substrate to
  confine the Mie resonances within the nanowires of the index tunable layers. We
  outline the fabrication process developed to form such tunable metasurface elements
  using a four-step projection lithography process and a self-aligned vertical dry
  etch. We experimentally demonstrate the operation of an electrically reconfigurable
  optical antenna element where the resonant wavelength blue shifts by 200nm only
  during carrier-injection. We extrapolate the experimentally measured InAs refractive
  index shifts to show we can achieve nearly {\pi} phase shift in a metasurface array.
  This solid-state device platform enables us to contact each resonant element independently
  to form a truly reconfigurable Fourier optical element with the promise of arbitrary
  control of the electromagnetic wavefront at the subwavelength scale.
