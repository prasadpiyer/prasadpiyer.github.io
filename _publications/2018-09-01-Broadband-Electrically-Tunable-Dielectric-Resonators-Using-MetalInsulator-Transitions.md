abstract: "Dielectric-resonator-based nanophotonic devices show promise owing to their\
  \ low intrinsic losses, support of multipolar resonances, and efficient operation\
  \ in both reflection and transmission configurations. A key challenge is to make\
  \ such devices dynamically switchable, such that optical behavior can be instantaneously\
  \ reconfigured. In this work we experimentally demonstrate large, broadband, and\
  \ continuous electrical tuning of reflection resonances in hybrid dielectric\u2013\
  VO2 devices. Our calculations, in strong agreement with experimental reflectance\
  \ measurements, also indicate the presence of large transmission and absorption\
  \ modulation. We additionally demonstrate independent modulation of both reflection\
  \ amplitude and phase at Fabry\u2013Perot anti-nodes and nodes, respectively, a\
  \ key requirement for metasurface design. We conclude with a temporal characterization,\
  \ in which we achieve rapid electronic modulation rates of approximately 3 kHz,\
  \ substantially faster than other recent approaches. These findings ..."
