abstract: "We demonstrate ultrafast non-reciprocal spin resonances in frustrated plasmonic metasurfaces, enabling novel approaches to optical isolation and non-reciprocal devices. Our work combines the unique properties of frustrated magnetic systems with plasmonic metasurfaces to achieve sub-picosecond control of spin dynamics, opening new possibilities for ultrafast optical switching and signal processing applications."
