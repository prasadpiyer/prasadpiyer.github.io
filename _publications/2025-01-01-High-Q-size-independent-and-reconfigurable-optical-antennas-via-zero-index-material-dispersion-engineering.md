abstract: Enhancing light-matter interactions at the nanoscale is foundational to
  nanophotonics, with epsilon near zero (ENZ) materials demonstrating significant
  potential.High-quality (Q) factor resonances maximizing these interactions are typically
  realized in photonic crystals requiring sub-50 nm precision nanofabrication over
  large areas, limiting scalability and increasing complexity. Mie resonances offer
  an alternative but are constrained by low Q factors due to the scarcity of high
  refractive index materials, necessitating large refractive index changes for effective
  resonance switching and limiting dynamic reconfigurability. We overcome these limitations
  by embedding Mie resonators within ENZ media, thereby enhancing Q- factors, mitigating
  geometric dispersion and fabrication challenges, and maximizing optical reconfigurability.
  We introduce three resonator-ENZ configurations - voids in AlN, Ge in $SiO_2$, and
  intrinsic InSb in doped InSb - spanning from low-loss phononic to lossy plasmonic
  ENZ modes.Using novel epitaxial regrowth techniques, we achieve significant Q-factor
  improvements over non-embedded resonators. Notably, an air-based Mie resonator embedded
  in AlN supports resonant Q-factors exceeding 100, with negligible geometric dispersion
  across sizes from 800 nm to 2,800 nm. Additionally, we demonstrate dynamic reconfigurability
  of intrinsic InSb resonators by thermally tuning the ENZ wavelength over a 2$\mu$m
  range in the mid-infrared (11-16 $\mu$m) wavelength regime. These results showcase
  the potential of Mie resonators embedded in ENZ media for high-fidelity sensors,
  thermal emitters, and reconfigurable metasurfaces, bridging theoretical predictions
  with practical applications, advancing the development of dynamic, high-Q optical
  devices.
