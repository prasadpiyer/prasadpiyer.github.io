abstract: Abstract Solid-state quantum emitters (QE) can produce single photons required
  for quantum information processing. However, their emission properties often exhibit
  poor directivity and polarisation definition resulting in considerable loss of generated
  photons. Here we propose and numerically evaluate Mie metasurface designs for outcoupling
  photons from an embedded and randomly-positioned QE. These Mie metasurface designs
  can provide over one order of magnitude enhancement in photon outcoupling with only
  several percent of photons being lost. Importantly, the Mie metasurfaces provide
  the enhancement in photon outcoupling without the need for strict QE position alignment
  and without affecting the intrinsic QE emission rate (Purcell enhancement). Electric
  dipole modes are key for achieving the enhancement and they offer a path for selective
  outcoupling for photons emitted with specific polarisation, including the out-of-plane
  polarisation. Mie metasurfaces can provide an efficient, polarisation-selective
  and scalable platform for QEs.
