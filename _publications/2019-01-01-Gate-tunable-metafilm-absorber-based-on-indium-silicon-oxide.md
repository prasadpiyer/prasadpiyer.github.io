abstract: Abstract In this work, reconfigurable metafilm absorbers based on indium
  silicon oxide (ISO) were investigated. The metafilm absorbers consist of nanoscale
  metallic resonator arrays on metal-insulator-metal (MIM) multilayer structures.
  The ISO was used as an active tunable layer embedded in the MIM cavities. The tunable
  metafilm absorbers with ISO were then fabricated and characterized. A maximum change
  in the reflectance of 57% and up to 620 nm shift in the resonance wavelength were
  measured.
