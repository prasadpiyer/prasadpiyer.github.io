abstract: "Metasurfaces are two-dimensional nanostructures that allow unprecedented\
  \ control of light through engineering the amplitude, phase, and polarization across\
  \ meta-atom resonators. Adding tunability to metasurface components would boost\
  \ their potential and unlock a vast array of new application possibilities such\
  \ as dynamic beam steering, tunable metalenses, and reconfigurable meta-holograms,\
  \ to name a few. We present here high-index meta-atoms, resonators, and metasurfaces\
  \ reconfigured by thermal effects, across the near to mid-infrared spectral ranges.\
  \ We study thermal tunability in group IV and group IV\u2013VI semiconductors, as\
  \ well as in phase-transition materials, and demonstrate large dynamic resonance\
  \ frequency shifts accompanied by significant amplitude and phase modulation in\
  \ metasurfaces and resonators. We highlight the importance of high-Q resonances\
  \ along with peak performance of thermal and thermo-optic effects, for efficient\
  \ and practical reconfigurable devices. This paper paves the way to efficient high-Q\
  \ reconfigurable and active infrared metadevices."
