abstract: "Since the discovery of the laser, optical nonlinearities have been at the core of efficient light conversion sources. Typically,
thick transparent crystals or quasi-phase matched waveguides, are utilized in conjunction with phase-matching
techniques to select a single parametric process. In recent years, due to the rapid developments in artificially structured
materials, optical frequency mixing has been achieved at the nanoscale in subwavelength resonators arrayed as
metasurfaces. Phase matching becomes relaxed for these wavelength-scale structures, and all allowed nonlinear processes
can, in principle, occur on an equal footing. This could promote harmonic generation via a cascaded (consisting of several
frequency mixing steps) process. However, so far, all reported work on dielectric metasurfaces have assumed frequency
mixing from a direct (single step) nonlinear process. In this work, we prove the existence of cascaded second-order optical
nonlinearities by analyzing the second and third wave mixing from a highly nonlinear metasurface in conjunction with
polarization selection rules and crystal symmetries. We find that the third wave mixing signal from a cascaded process
can be of comparable strength to that from conventional third harmonic generation, and that surface nonlinearities are
the dominant mechanism that contributes to cascaded second order nonlinearities in our metasurface."
