abstract: "We report tunable semiconductor Mie-resonant antennas integrated with an epsilon-near-zero back-reflector that amplify thermo-optic free-carrier effects. Temperature-induced carrier excitation in InSb enables >3 µm continuous resonance tuning in the mid-infrared, realizing an unprecedented 25 %-bandwidth spectral agility for planar metadevices."
