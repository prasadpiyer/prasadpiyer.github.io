abstract: We describe a time-domain nano-photonic design principle for controlling
  electromagnetic waves at femtosecond timescales and illustrate a metasurface design
  that numerically demonstrates streaking of ultrafast pulses passively using arrays
  of resonance-based dielectric metasurfaces.
