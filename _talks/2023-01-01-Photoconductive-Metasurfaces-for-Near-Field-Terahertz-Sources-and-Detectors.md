abstract: Aperture near-field microscopy and spectroscopy (a-SNOM) enables the direct
  experimental investigation of subwavelength-sized resonators by sampling highly
  confined local evanescent fields on the sample surface. Despite its success, the
  versatility and applicability of a-SNOM is limited by the sensitivity of the aperture
  probe, as well as the power and versatility of THz sources used to excite samples.
  Recently, perfectly absorbing photoconductive metasurfaces have been integrated
  into THz photoconductive antenna detectors, enhancing their efficiency and enabling
  high signal-to-noise ratio THz detection at significantly reduced optical pump powers.
  Here, we discuss how this technology can be applied to aperture near-field probes
  to improve both the sensitivity and potentially spatial resolution of a-SNOM systems.
  In addition, we explore the application of photoconductive metasurfaces also as
  near-field THz sources, providing the possibility of tailoring the beam profile,
  polarity and phase of THz excitation. Photoconductive metasurfaces therefore have
  the potential to broaden the application scope of aperture near-field microscopy
  to samples and material systems which currently require improved spatial resolution,
  signal-to-noise ratio, or more complex excitation conditions.
