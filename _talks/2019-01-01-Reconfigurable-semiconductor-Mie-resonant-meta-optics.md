abstract: Metasurfaces allow unprecedented control of light through engineering the
  amplitude, phase and polarization across arrays of meta-atom resonators. Adding
  dynamic tunability to metasurface components would boost their potential and unlock
  a vast array of new application possibilities such as dynamic beam steering, LIDAR,
  tunable metalenses and reconfigurable meta-holograms, to name a few. We present
  here high-index reconfigurable metaatoms, resonators and metasurfaces that can dynamically
  and continuously tune their frequency, amplitude and phase, across the near to mid-infrared
  spectral ranges. We highlight the importance of narrow linewidth resonances along
  with peak performance of tunable mechanisms for efficient and practical reconfigurable
  devices.
