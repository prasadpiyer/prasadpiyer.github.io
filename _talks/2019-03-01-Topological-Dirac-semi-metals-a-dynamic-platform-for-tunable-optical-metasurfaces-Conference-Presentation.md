abstract: Despite the significant advances made in the field of metamaterials and
  metasurfaces in recent years, many applications of such devices are hampered by
  the lack of active refractive index tuning. Here, we report on a new class of tunable
  quantum materials based on 3D topological Dirac semimetals with extremely high electrical
  and thermal refractive index tuning. Realized optical reflectivity data, performed
  on thin films of Cd3As2 over a broad range of frequencies demonstrate larger than
  traditional thermo-optic shifts in III-V semiconductors. Dynamic Fermi level tuning,
  instigated from the Pauli blocking in the linear Dirac cone, offers large and tunable
  absorption peak in the mid-infrared region. In contrast to recent efforts in 3D
  Dirac semimetals which are mostly focused on single crystal Cd3As2, our data based
  on MBE-grown Cd3As2 can galvanize newfound applications in the field of meta-optics
  and can enable several applications such as ultra-thin programmable optical devices,
  photodetectors, and on-chip directional antennas.
