abstract: "We present a self-driving laboratory approach that discovered novel configurations of semiconductor metasurfaces enabling high-efficiency directional incoherent emission. By combining automated experimentation with machine learning, we identified optimal metasurface designs that achieve unprecedented control over emission directionality and efficiency, demonstrating the potential of AI-driven materials research for photonic applications."
