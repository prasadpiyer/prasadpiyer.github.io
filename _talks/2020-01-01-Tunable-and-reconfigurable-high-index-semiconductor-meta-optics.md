abstract: Metasurfaces manipulate light through engineering the amplitude, phase and
  polarization across arrays of meta-atom antenna resonators. Adding tunability and
  active functionality to metasurface components would boost their potential and unlock
  a vast array of new application possibilities such as dynamic beam steering, LIDAR,
  tunable metalenses, reconfigurable meta-holograms and many more. We present here
  high-index reconfigurable meta-atoms, resonators and metasurfaces that can dynamically
  and continuously tune their frequency, amplitude and phase, across the infrared
  spectral ranges. We utilize narrow linewidth resonances along with peak performance
  of tunable mechanisms for efficient and practical reconfigurable devices.
