* **M.S. Electrical & Computer Engineering (Electronics and Photonics)**, University of California – Santa Barbara, Apr 2014  
* **B.Tech. Materials & Metallurgical Engineering**, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Jul 2012

## Professional Experience

* **Senior Member of Technical Staff**, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque NM — *Nov 2020 – Present*  
  • Principal Investigator on projects in scientific-ML, quantum optics and reconfigurable metasurfaces.  
  • Affiliate Scientist, CINT; lead a group of 3 post-docs and collaborate with ~10 staff scientists.

* **Technical Advisor**, Neurophos & Lumotive — *May 2021 – Jun 2022*  
  • Guided productisation of reconfigurable metasurfaces for optical computing (Neurophos).  
  • Supported design of beam-steering liquid-crystal metasurfaces for LiDARs (Lumotive).

* **Senior LiDAR Systems Engineer**, Lumotive, Seattle WA — *Apr 2018 – Oct 2020*  
  • Led design of beam-steering metasurfaces using CMOS and LCOS platforms.  
  • Architected LiDAR link-budget and read-out electronics; developed denoising algorithms for point-cloud data.

## Selected Publications
- Sub-picosecond steering of ultrafast incoherent emission from semiconductor metasurfaces (Nature Photonics, 2023) – Demonstrated dynamic steering of 140 fs incoherent light pulses over 70° field-of-view using InAs quantum-dot GaAs metasurfaces.
- Unidirectional photoluminescence from InGaN/GaN quantum-well metasurfaces (Nature Photonics, 2020) – Engineered the photonic density-of-states to direct emission over 10°–80° via dielectric metasurfaces embedding quantum wells.
- AutoSciLab: A Self-Driving Laboratory for Interpretable Scientific Discovery (AAAI, 2025) – Developed a machine-learning framework that autonomously drives experiments to obtain human-interpretable discoveries; ranked within the top 5 % of 13 000 submissions.
- Control of quantized spontaneous emission from single GaAs quantum dots embedded in Huygens metasurfaces (Nano Letters, 2024) – Achieved position-independent single-photon emission from isolated GaAs QDs in AlGaAs metasurfaces.
