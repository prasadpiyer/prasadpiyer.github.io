abstract: "A device may include a dielectric substrate layer with an array of multicoated elongated metal rails extending from the dielectric substrate parallel to one another and spaced from one another to form channels therebetween. The dimensions of the multicoated elongated metal rails and the channels therebetween may be subwavelength with respect to an operational bandwidth. In some examples, each multicoated elongated metal rail is formed with a copper core coated with an optically reflective silver coating followed by a passivation coating. In various examples, a conductive barrier material separates each multicoated elongated metal rail from an underlying dielectric substrate layer. A tunable dielectric material that has a tunable refractive index, such as liquid crystal, is positioned within the channels between adjacent multicoated elongated metal rails."
