abstract: "According to various embodiments, a cover is sealed over a metasurface on a substrate to create a sealed chamber. Liquid crystal, or another tunable refractive index dielectric material, is positioned within the sealed chamber around optical structures of the metasurface before or after the cover is sealed. For example, the liquid crystal may be injected through small vias or holes to fill a sealed chamber. In some embodiments, a glass cover is shaped or patterned with photoresist to protrude into the sealed chamber to reduce the thickness of the liquid crystal used to fill the sealed chamber. A driver to control the metasurface may be, for example, integrated within the substrate, be attached to exposed bond pads of the metasurface, and/or be embodied as a control layer connected to the metasurface through the substrate by through-substrate vias (TSVs)."
